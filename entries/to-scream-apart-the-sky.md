# To Scream Apart the Sky

(Originally prepared in May 2025, as part of a collection called *The Path to Utopia* which would become [TEETH](/teeth))

AND IF I GAVE YOU THE WORDS  
TO SCREAM APART THE SKY  
WOULD YOU LOOSE THEM LIKE ARROWS  
HAILED UPON THE SOIL-TO-BE  
OF CRUELTY'S MOST FAITHFUL  
RUSHING HEADLONG TO WAR?

COULD YOUR TONGUE ALONE LIBERATE  
YOUR MOUTH, YOUR LIPS  
YOUR HOME, YOUR CITY  
GENERATION AFTER GENERATION?  
WERE WE WAITING FOR YOUR SAY-SO?

WHEN YOU FIND THE WORDS  
TO SCREAM APART THE SKY  
YOU WILL SPEAK THEM  
WITH YOUR WHOLE BODY  
AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE
