# To Scream Apart the Sky

(Originally prepared in May 2025, as part of a collection called *The Path to Utopia* which would become [TEETH](/teeth))

AND IF I GAVE YOU THE WORDS  
TO SCREAM APART THE SKY  
HOW WOULD YOU KEEP THEM
FROM SUNDERING THE EARTH?

COULD YOUR TONGUE ALONE LIBERATE  
YOUR MOUTH, YOUR MUSCLES  
YOUR HOME, YOUR NEIGHBORS  
GENERATION AFTER GENERATION?  
WERE WE WAITING FOR YOUR SAY-SO?

WHEN YOU FIND THE WORDS  
TO SCREAM APART THE SKY  
YOU WILL SPEAK THEM  
WITH YOUR WHOLE BODY  
AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE
