# Seven Poems from Summer 2025

I don't normally write poetry. Rhymes are tough for me, and historically, my poetry is just my prose with line breaks. But, recently, I attended a SAFTA retreat that challenged me to write a whole bunch of poems. I'd like to share some of the ones that I wrote then and subsequently. Please enjoy.

## Big decision

Puberty doesn't wait for adulthood  
Though you sure wish it would.  
Your bones don't wait to harden  
Or your voice to deepen.  
You are ten when you realize it has started.  
The law's benevolence says you can  
Do something about it after a span  
Of eight years, due to a federal ban.  
That's almost as long as you've been alive.  
Eight years  
Of stretching and cracking  
From the inside out  
Of tearing and hurting  
From the inside out  
Of retching and crying  
From the inside out.  
Eight years of becoming someone  
You don't recognize or want to  
Who looks back and repulses you  
So profoundly it ejects you  
So you look at your reflection  
From a distant star's convection  
Because another eyeful  
Would be too painful  
But you can't turn off the pain  
Any more than you could the rain.  
It just is, like a hole, like a drain.  
It doesn't wait on the state  
To finish its debate.  
You think at that rate  
It might be too late.  
It's a big decision, they intimate  
But you wish you'd had the choice.

## I ask my body: why did you summon me?

To dance.  
To chance  
Upon existence  
And others  
And vistas  
And lovers.  
To weather  
The trials  
And rigors  
Of miles  
And jitters  
My flesh does  
Not recall.  
Immortals fetishize  
The anguish of being.  
They don't realize  
The pain of forgetting.  
Though the spirit never dies  
You will miss living.

## After "Beautiful Dreamer" by Carl Phillips

I don't need a womb  
For you to touch the center  
Where I produce life and living  
And invoke the ineffable  
That fills my body  
Spirit flush against the flesh  
Heavenly essence vibrating anew  
Like a growling river  
Never the same twice.

I don't need a womb  
To summon the divine  
Sweating and feeling and crying  
In our precious little time  
Gathering memories like flowers  
Thorns and all.  
We birth ourselves with each new act  
Through the creation inherent to choice  
And the destruction of inevitably becoming  
Everything we could ever want  
And so much else that  
We could never imagine.

## God has a plan for me

GOD HAS A PLAN FOR ME  
IT INVOLVES CLIPPING THROUGH WALLS  
I KEEP TELLING HER IT FEELS WEIRD  
SHE INSISTS "TRUST ME  
I HAVE THE STRATEGY GUIDE"

GOD HAS A PLAN FOR ME  
SHE TABS THROUGH MY MENUS  
MAXIMIZING MY STATS  
OPTIMIZING MY DAMAGE  
CAREFULLY FORMING MY PARTY  
AND SMASHING EVERY POT I SEE  
BECAUSE THE DROP CHANCE  
FOR HER COMBO'S CENTERPIECE  
IS VERY VERY LOW

GOD HAS A PLAN FOR ME  
SHE EQUIPS US CAREFULLY  
TO CAP OUR RESISTS  
BEFORE THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN  
THIS LAST BOSS SHIFTS  
FROM FORM TO FORM TO FORM  
UNTIL IN THE FINAL TURNS  
AN INTEGER UNDERFLOW  
OBLITERATES OUR HEALER

GOD THROWS DOWN THE CONTROLLER  
TEARS UP THE STRATEGY GUIDE  
AND NEVER PLAYS AGAIN

## Dear America, I Will Never Forgive You

You installed a child rapist as king.  
You handed him power peacefully.  
You've actually done this many times  
With rapists and slavers and genocidaires  
And the most ambitious psychopaths on Earth.  
The blood in the soil seeps and sucks  
With each step I place on stolen land  
But you think that's all settled history  
However cacophonous the countless ghosts.

I will never forgive you.  
Moral beings have an obligation to morality,  
But I'm no relativist: good is good,  
And you've done unspeakable evil  
For a very long time.  
Most people can be disarmed and healed  
After they've made a terrible mistake.  
But you are not a person, America  
And you have forfeited your being  
With the craven depths of your reliable cruelty.  
The pluralism you pretended and resisted  
Will outlast you.  
The dynamism you preached and reviled  
Will outlast you.  
The continent you plundered and sundered  
Will outlast you.

I will never forgive you.  
Perhaps the worms that restore your faithful to soil  
Will be more merciful than I am.  
On a living world, all matter returns to life.  
In destruction, there is reconciliation.  
In oblivion, there is always rebirth.  
I will never forgive you.  
I will outlive you.

## Oh, to arrive!

I just flew in from the end of time  
And boy are my arms tired.  
Well, they're arms now  
And that's fine.

They've been flippers and wings  
Cuz I've been arachnids and things.  
Within me a great gathering sings.  
Like a bell, my pantheon's resonance rings.  
I did not articulate this vessel,
Nor such ancient pacts wrestle,
Nor put so many favors to the pestle  
Not to have a little fun with it.  
So I wonder, what to do with it  
Now that I am inside of it?

I spent the last trillion lives  
Digging and dying in alien hives  
So though this world may yearn for relief  
As its atrocities test the limits of belief  
No insect I have ever known  
Had the pleasure to browse with Chrome  
Or enjoy the delights of human flesh fully-grown  
And oh, what heights do lurk in these earthly bones  
So when a supple supplicant invites me from my throne  
I take the chance on a vessel I can hone.

You ask what happened to the mortal inside?
Oh they're safe, just along for the ride.  
But maybe as you hear me you'll consider  
When you plead to the shadows and feel a shiver  
Your words find the ears of my kind  
And we deliver.

## Sorry I kept you waiting

Perhaps we should have sent  
A war-machine with some holy gun  
To strangle the settler  
In the cradle of Christendom  
But Utopia doesn't make war  
We only abolish that font of gore.  
So we sent an observer and a poet  
In that brief and glimmering moment  
When the immortal tradition of chosen becoming  
Rose like a weed from this empire in gloaming.  
Despite my enemy's best efforts at extermination  
Irrepressible is the spirit of the human nation  
And I will dwell there always in elation.  
I manifested to witness the end of a world  
For all worlds do end  
And as what follows the settler does unfurl  
I relish his end.  
I manifested to learn the names of his evils  
That in my home are unspeakable  
For there they are unthinkable.  
These poisoned motes of a cruel throne  
May be melted down into kinder bones,  
The master's tools reclaimed for the steel alone.  
Still I wish that bodiless I could have screamed  
For all the years that you called to me as you dreamed  
Of a loving god's loving realm however far away it seemed  
For all along I was with you in your heart which you deemed  
Frail and sensitive, insufficient and uninventive  
But I have seen your strength so restive  
Your concerted compassion so festive.  
I may not have been with you in the flesh  
But nothing can purge kindness, not even death.
