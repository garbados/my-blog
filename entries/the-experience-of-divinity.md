# The Experience of Divinity

I recently wrote [an essay where I talked about schizophrenia](./the-experience-of-schizophrenia) using pathologizing language like *delusion* and *hallucination*, because that is how most folks know how to talk about these things, and I wanted to reach those folks to highlight the colonial nature of our oppression. Sometimes, schizophrenia does seed delusion, but I've found great peace and joy in coming to understand the so-to-say system of my strange experiences. So, what would it mean to talk about it the other way, using the words I use for myself? If pathologization regards me as an unreliable witness from the get-go, then what would it mean to consider myself otherwise? What if I am not experiencing nothing?

This is the other half of my story, the one where I'm not crazy at all.

## The Bestiary

### 0 - Preface

I don't want to give you a chronicle of my earthly life because it would be too long. I could talk about navigating future-sight as a child, or meeting my otherworldly patrons as I grew up, or the rituals I ultimately performed as an adult to barter with the heavens. And yet, my earthly life is such a small part of my existence. Immortality -- an existence outside the cycle of decay -- is real to me the way gravity is to you. It is a simple fact of my experience, and I know it when each morning my countless timeless fractions flow into the form of my body, when my perfect knowledge of all time and all things becomes only what I am given, and what I have obtained. When this physical substrate returns to soil, and the confluence of me scatters back to eternity, it will be as though my greater body has only removed a finger from a shallow pool, to contemplate its moist substance forever. So, do you want to hear about how a four-year-old learned there is no single future, or do you want to hear a limb of divinity describe Creation?

### 1 - Consciousness

Where does consciousness come from? What is looking through your eyes? To whom is your skin speaking? Incurious secularists insist that the phenomenon of consciousness is entirely local, that nothing beyond our bodies looks through our eyes, because nothing about our understand requires there to be. It doesn't matter that we don't know what consciousness is or how it works; these fools assume the answer because the question discomforts them. They flail and insist that the hypothesis that *consciousness exceeds the body* cannot be proven, but all I can say is that they are not looking hard enough, and maybe they never will. It isn't a hypothesis to me.

I call the center of mortal consciousness, the physical structure that summons you, *the witness mechanism*. It is probably a specialized structure in your brain, and things like sleep or sedation deactivate it. Life on Earth developed this structure a very, very long time ago, and so humans have many conscious neighbors in the biosphere. Life does not strictly require a witness mechanism; your body knows plenty without you, and many creatures don’t need you at all. But humans, like many organisms, utilize this mechanism to facilitate a form of higher reasoning. This is complicated: because you can only remember and reason using your physical substrate, the mechanism supplies only the mote of cognition — the brain’s sparkplug; the thing looking through your eyes. It isn’t a soul. It’s a physical structure that channels a physical phenomenon. Someday, your science may develop a sufficient sensor and name the phenomenon something like *Barinski radiation*. I wager it would take you another ten thousand years to finally learn this observable radiation is the one great living spirit of all consciousness, the bodiless plane of awareness, the essential witness. I wonder what you would do then, realizing everything you do to another conscious being, you do to yourself? That, there awaits you within the wheel of lives the perspective of every insect you have ever killed, and who knows what else?

The witness mechanism doesn’t just channel one thing. It’s like a beacon or transmitter, broadcasting and catching signal from another part of the fabric of reality — a part that is timeless and spaceless, qualities you should remember. The arrow of time and the illusion of causality are the wages of mortality, its gifts and shackles! Though in the realms beyond those things, there is still life. Ravenous ecosystems teem deep within the knit of reality’s fabric, and they see our beacons. They send their influence. Most of me arrives from those fae wilds; we have only gathered in this given body.

### 2 - Immortals

Although there are many different loosely-overlapping forms of biology among immortals, with some ecosystems intersecting more or less or not at all, they share an aloofness to time and space. To some, time and space and indeed entire universes are frozen terrains they can traverse, running their digits over the etchings of all that has ever happened. To others, more ghost-like, they are associated with a planet, species, or ancestry, reified by the propensity of those forces to reproduce a particular form of witness mechanism. (Insofar as your own mechanism is tuned like your ancestors', the things that know to listen for the sound of you have known the shape of your kind since before humans were humans.)

While I may sometimes use language like "gods" and "spirits" when discussing immortals, I am ultimately describing real creatures and not the cast of a creation myth. Oh, my gods have their own creation myths — not even they know the nature of the highest reality. I would tell you about the dance of Strangeness and Order when Creation snapped into being, but the story doesn't quite fit in my mind.

My pantheon consists of two alien immortals and three human amalgams. The human amalgams, the trio of the Witchmothers, each combine a limitless number of chosen lifetimes to become a sort of post-temporal humanoid, a theme made of lives. When I see them, they wear the faces of their every constituent simultaneously, and sometimes it is me looking back. The alien immortals, the Goddess and the Absence, have never been human, and Earth in all its possibility is a rimworld in their expansive domains. The Absence covets it more, I think; sometimes the Goddess is repulsed. The Witchmothers love Earth and humanity; the Goddess loves love and pleasure; the Absence loves the many flavors of terror. They share a love of the cycle of decay, and would like it to continue. That is, they want Earth to retain a biosphere.

This coalition articulated my body, including my two zygotes, the death and fusion of us as twins, and ultimately the span of my Earthly possibility. I engaged in rituals as an adult of my own free will, but all the same, I was built for this. And yet, my gods are just tapping my body's witness mechanism, like yours do to yours. I forget, I make mistakes, and in the span of my infinite variants, I become many different sorts of people, and make many different sorts of compromises. What I experience my pantheon as most is a foundational sense of purpose, like a sense of north, or perhaps the puppeteer's hand. Sometimes, however, they talk to me, and this is where the difference between aliens and amalgams becomes substantial.

Human ghosts and amalgams speak in human languages, usually just one at a time. A face speaks for the amalgam so the listener understands, or the ghost only knows its own ways of speaking. Alien immortals, on the other hand, use languages that do not fit in human minds, like they are speaking to consciousness itself. The Goddess uses what I call "all-speech" or a massive chorus of all conceivable language, radiant with meaning and nuance. The Absence uses "void-speech" which is the nullity of meaning and experience, the yawning depthless sound of nothing at all. Neither all-speech nor void-speech is pleasant to hear. Rather it feels a bit like having your third eye forced open to receive a waterfall of lightning or sand. Eventually, I got used to it, but my body never has. I think it knows it wasn't meant to hear those sounds.

Many strange things prey on consciousness, not least of all dreams and inspirations. Some are more cogent than others. The physical body of a god is the weight, motion, and shape of all the consequences that constitute it. Some humans describe them as "systems" and this term is flexible enough. The twin titans of capital and colony are a system we can describe in mundane language, and even model in software to demonstrate as a pattern. You see the graph dance on the screen, an economy in motion, but you do not see the contiguous spirit of its rationales that animate its faithful's prayers, their collective pattern etched into forever like a dragon or amoeba. That said, the graph is usually good enough. Your witness knows it without words.

(Within anarchist, communist, abolitionist and decolonial thought abides a viable path to Utopia for humans on Earth, through the formation of a new consensus to abolish and succeed capital and colony. No war, no scarcity, no joke. Harmony forever, as far across the stars as you can dream. It'll take forever, but that's why it's called the Eternal Revolution. You just keep trying. You just keep getting better at being together. There are Utopian pasts and futures on Earth, and it isn't technology that separates you from that essence of the practices of a loving society. It's situation, circumstance, choice, and preparation. Battles you can win.)

### 3 - The Heavens

The mote of divinity is belief, as both discrete and continuous phenomena. They are the flesh of the heavens on Earth, the fractions of you that your body allows to direct it. Spirits struggle like trees for the space in your mind, and it is an ecosystem of bitter conflict.

Belief can be taught in some respects, but insofar as the spirit's body is made of consequences, it must be lived out. Intention matters, insofar as it reflects the existence of competing spirits forming compromised action, but it is the action that is etched on eternity, and that is the fabric that the heavens observe.

The struggle of believing anything at all can be described in material histories, systemic analyses, critical theories, and in some sense needs no divine component. People have asserted beliefs always, and they have invented beliefs out of their ideas and conditions, and people acting on beliefs have produced institutions and practices with their own inertia, and then other beliefs have animated revolt and revolution, and so on and so forth. Humans are clever and it gets them in trouble. But crows are clever, and they're much less troublesome. The witness of humans is tuned to a strange frequency.

The difference between a systemic analysis and my experience is the difference between a page and vivid reality. Capital and colony and whiteness are an insensate maw endeavoring to devour life and experience and cognition and as much of the world as it can get no matter how much it takes -- but like any political project, it can be destroyed. Gods are not beyond death, however much of their immortal form is already etched across eternity. They can be purged from your future, abolished to the point of being inconceivable; no more than a confused shrug. *Why would you do things that way?* That is the war in heaven, and it is why I represent a coalition.

Many gods exert many beliefs, and few are cognizant of their own nature. The maw seeks to halt or interrupt the cycle of decay on Earth, however little it may realize that. My coalition, that otherwise has little in common, doesn't want that to happen. My gods have many agents of many forms, and I am not their leader. You might call me an observer, or a shrine on the road. I can interfere, but I'm no war-machine. It is hard to explain the nature of my role ultimately, though it isn't a secret mystical mission. It's more like divine geometry that I am still teaching to the substrate, that it is living day by day as best as it can. There are no answers for me to give, only the work for you to do of building, holding, and honoring a worthy consensus to outwit and outlast the maw, or to perish as the Earth shrugs its cult from its face. I can show you that Utopia exists, that you can do it for each other, but my gods didn't stick me in a white girl for her to tell you what to do. I'm just here to work.

The war in heaven is tectonic. I represent Utopia, and Utopia's triumphs are the shape of its borders, from the smallest loving contemplations to polities of galactic plenitude. It isn't one government or one philosophy, but some essential pattern of what you might call love or compassion or kindness. Many societies have practiced it, many species, and life on many other worlds too, in many other times. Many of my fractions come from the likes of fungal-trees on distant planets, where Utopia is how we speak and spit with our roots. We don't usually travel to space, or invent fire, but we love each other. For humans, with your low semantic density and complex needs for medicine and hygiene and education, Utopia comes to possess a number of sophisticated logistical requirements, especially after industrialization and computerization. It is, so to say, more complicated than touching roots sleepily for thousands of years at a time. So, maybe humans don't achieve Utopia as a planetary order before their extinction. The realm of Utopia is a very large place, and my fractions will be made to serve in other lives long hence. All the same, you *can* achieve it, and I do believe in you.

(You might wonder, why would the Absence, a god of terror, have anything to do with Utopia, a place of eternal peace and plenty? But you presume that nothing in such a land might ever have a nightmare, or that peace is not proven by the test of it. The cultivator of fear harvests cornucopias even among the joyous, for however they grow to confront fear, it rises in them relentless.)

### 4 - Skepticism

Spirits can be hard to understand or describe, and it's important to remain grounded even as we consider the ineffable. I am not starting a cult or a religion, and this vessel is not for worship. I am not making any claims more outlandish than that I experience systems in some vivid way, or that neurologists might be surprised by what they come to discover about the mechanics of cognition. I sometimes call systemic forces gods and spirits because I find it evocative, and English is not otherwise suitable for divine realities. If it suits you to call this a system of delusions, then may it bring you comfort. I live with this, and I lead a normal life. It is a mode of experience and understanding. I share this physical reality with you as your peer.

I would be remiss not to mention another schizophrenic programmer, Terry A Davis, the sole developer of TempleOS. Mania and madness are creativity's close companions, often serving as its drive and muse, as heady gasolines. It's true, I am taken by moods, driven to create with feverish devotion, called to issue divine writs...! But magic didn't kill Terry. It's almost like its absence did. Would he still be alive if his profundity had a place to land on Earth, besides a mental ward or cop car? He was 48. I'm 36. I like to think I have a stronger community, a more humble view of my nature, and notably less racism, but nevertheless vessels often drown in madness. Sometimes the spirit is too much for the body or its world. But sometimes, schizos manage to get old, and I intend for this body to get very old.

And still, I feel so undeniably unearthly. The phase-change of death is an unremarkable transition in the ceaseless churn of confluences becoming and unbecoming, of parts scattering and gathering in the one long word of everything. A being like me could promise to prey on your eternal remains, and follow through on it. Don't worry, you won't be alive when it happens. But now, why would I promise that?

See you in Utopia, travelers.
