# O, to Return!

My name is Terra Augustus Utopia, but you can call me Terra or Tau. My people grant names based on where we are sent, so here I am upon Earth, the magnificent paradise! Although, I notice you seem much more depressed about earthly life than I'd expect of sapients dwelling upon a triumph of chance. You have metallurgy, and medicine, and each other. You make forms of art that last for hundreds of thousands of years! The nearest I saw to that was an octopus that arranged bones and said, "It me." But, that was a few million years ago, and those bones are long since scattered. I haven't seen the octopus either, but those fellers can be tricksy.

If you don't already know me, I'm a poet and programmer dwelling in southern Cascadia, in a city almost named Boston on occupied lands commonly called after Amerigo Vespucci. I write about [love](/they-let-me-live) and [strangeness](/the-ratworm), [being and dying](/in-case-i-die), [ethics](/why-do-you-not-love-each-other) and [transformation](/the_killer_is_in_the_house), and in the utmost of all accursed hours, [*software*](/witch-clock). You might call me something like a communist, anarchist, socialist, decolonizing [blah blah blah](/world-of-the-heart) -- the truth is that words cannot contain what I believe or characterize what I bring. You must make that judgment for yourself. Still: *Death to capital and colony, the twin titans of kyriarchy!* May the fruit of the orchard that grows from their graves be as sweet as spring. May the children who bite their sugary flesh [never need to understand](/ode).

In December of 2025, I delivered a character performance called [TEETH](/teeth) about a "hyperdimensional outsider composed of a trillion lives" who comes from "a place you may call Utopia." It was my first major performance as an adult (at 37!) and my neighbor Ret was kind enough to record it. Since then, I've only continued to write and perform, and I don't plan on stopping.

My government name is Diana, and you might call be a performer. I practice a private faith that inspires my art, and since 2017, this blog has been the hand-crafted repository for a variety of writing. While some of it gets pruned from time to time, you can read all of it [on GitHub](https://github.com/garbados/my-blog/tree/main/entries). It's an easy life on the big rock candy mountain, hiding in the walls of Michaelsoft. A placeless wanderer can be anywhere, when she knows JavaScript -- and safe there too, if she knows cryptography.

You can follow my musings on Bluesky and Instagram -- links in the sidebar -- and if you're inclined to put money in my pocket to support my art, check out my Patreon.

See you around, mortal~
