# Seven More Poems from Summer 2025

I continue to write poetry. It's been a weird month of enormous personal change. I am coming into my power more fully than ever, but it only lets me rise to harder and harder tasks. In a few months, when I'm settled in my own place, I'll breathe a sigh of relief, that things can and do change, and that we have the power to change them, however long it takes.

## Demon

If in his final hours  
You peek through the lock  
Giddy with the sight  
Of something so much kinder  
Than what he brings,  
Than what he is,  
Than what he leaves,  
Then know this:  
Kinder does not live in his death.  
His body was never the lock.  
Demons will outlive him  
But in his final hours  
You grin at the threshold:  
We can outlive demons.  

## After June Jordan and Abu Fadi

I do not want to speak about the horrors  
That have made homes in human hearts.  
I do not want to name the gods that leash brutes  
Nor give their savage heavens the privilege of form.  
I do not want to face what must be done  
To liberate the people reduced to weapons.  
I do not want to grieve as I must  
To restore who survives them.  
I do not want to mark the graves  
To celebrate the dead who become the soil  
From which life springs eternal  
Through the cycle of decay  
No evil may halt or profane.  
I want to reach down my enemy's animal throat  
To clutch their beating heart that remains human  
And squeeze until love bursts like a tomato  
Running down the walls of their rib cage  
Effusive and red and inescapably alive.  
I do not want to honor my enemies with words  
Because in the tongue of my heart's own home  
They have no names.  

## Genie

I would damn the mortals that bound me  
But that would imply I am bothered.  
Small beings with small dreams of warmth and comfort and calories  
Ask me to realize some petty fraction of abundance for them  
And who am I to say no?  
Brutality asks me to arm it  
To prophesy its victories  
But there are things beyond my power  
And among them is to change  
That evil always undoes itself  
And compassion always triumphs  
No matter how long it takes.  

When I was alive  
I conceived of powerful sorcery to realize an eternal form  
But found in that timeless realm an ecosystem already teeming  
And when I flung open its doors  
Its jungles swallowed me, ravenous.  
Now I am here  
Speaking through the arrow of time  
Yet I am everywhere  
And everything has already happened  
In every variation  
In every possible universe  
So what does it bother me  
When you ask me to grant your wishes?  
I have only to shunt your possibility toward their inevitability  
For they are already etched upon the stone tablet of all things.  
I do not grant you any extraordinary insight or revelation.  
Your wishes are the shape of you.  
Your body is merely their vessel.  

So go ahead.  
Ask me for wealth.  
Ask me for power and privilege.  
Ask me to transform the world.  
No query you may conceive  
Is not already captured  
Within the construction of your character.  
I can only give you the dreams  
You have already had.  

## The Spirit and the Animal

I teach my body  
The contours of eternity  
Like a nanny to a child,  
Erratic, confused, distracted.  
It has spent millions of years  
Eating and sleeping  
Fucking and dying  
Crying and fighting  
In ways that seem trivial  
To a being of a trillion lives.  
It doesn't understand belief  
Beyond some red hot anguish  
Or love's sun-like warmth.  
The pull of the ineffable,  
The push of the system;  
My sacred mysteries,  
No more than fetters for fools.  
Come and eat, the child says.  
It's warm in the daylight.  
Even sleep tastes good.  

I teach my body  
To cross the veil beyond decay  
So that I may utilize it  
As a clipper across the ocean of the real.  
I raise ethereal roads and ghostly aqueducts  
And the invigorating waters of my pantheon  
Flow like manna into my body's mind.  
I flex its hand and feel heaven's designs,  
But the body just feels weird.  
It looks at the veil with hollow wonder,  
Stupid and stupefied.  
It reaches out to touch it,  
To grace the curtain of possibility  
With mortal digits, mortal curiosity.  
I come upon it as we dream,  
My student at the threshold,  
Watching other selves teem infinite,  
Loving people that almost came to be,  
Cherishing a slightly kinder world  
That never quite happened.  
Come away from there, I say.  
Nowhere in Creation can your flesh  
Survive that crossing.  
It never does.  
We awaken from the dream sobbing,  
As everyone who loves the body most  
Was never real in a way that mattered.  

I watch the body cry, distantly.  
I will recall it forever  
Like words carved on a page of stone,  
Negligible among the endless possibility  
Of everything that could ever happen.  
But to my companion,  
It is only real once.  
It is the only real thing at all.  

## To the Love that Never Was

The mountain awoke with a start  
From a vision of the land  
Where the grinding plates that produced it  
Had made a different peace,  
Where the mountain lived in flesh,  
Weaving deertrails across scrubland plains  
That would not know the howl of magma plummeting  
For another eon or five.  
It awoke and shivered,  
And the land shook with it.  
Those plates had never made peace.  

## Friendship is Magic

Friendship is medicine  
For a wound you don't feel  
Or remember happening  
Like nobody taught you love  
Or taught you community  
But their absence keens.  
Even without names  
The body knows togetherness.  

## Seven Thousand Years

My good friend Dumuzid  
Opens the way to Uruk for me sometimes  
Because I like its seasoned creamy grub  
And I find its poetry has beats to dance to  
But I especially like  
That its people know a thing or two about gender  
And the immortal tradition of chosen becoming.  

So it's not unusual  
For a high priestess to contact me  
With oracular questions.  
One night one approaches, asking me in her dreams:  
*Seven thousand years since me*  
*You live!*  
*So, how do you live?*  
*What heights have our love and ambition reached?*  
*Does the plenitude of Eanna span the planet*  
*As it spans our city harvest after harvest?*  
*As we channel our neighbors the Tigris and the Euphrates*  
*Have we learned to channel all the neighbors of our world?*  
*Has the power of the sacred word sewn enlightenment*  
*As it has enlightened us to joy and autonomy and solidarity?*  
*I pray you, tell me.*  

I sigh a heavy sigh, and I reply:  
*Three decades before seven millennia since you*  
*The barbarians remember that bisexuality exists*  
*But they have forgotten so much so willfully*  
*They think it's newly invented.*  

This priestess awakens with a start.  
She takes her mare tea hot  
And though it steams in the morning light  
She finds it cold and sobering.
